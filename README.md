# Apache-Web-Server

Apache HTTP Server is free and open-source cross-platform web server software. Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation.

Apache HTTP Server is cross-platform, meaning that it is built for Unix-like systems (e.g., macOS, Linux and FreeBSD) as well as Windows.
Apache played a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web growing as the dominant HTTP server, and has remained most popular since April 1996. In 2009, it became the first web server software to serve more than 100 million websites.

As of July 2016, Apache remained the most widely used web server software, estimated to serve 46% of all active websites and 43% of the top million websites.
