Web Server
A program that, using the client/server model and World Wide Webâ€™s HTTP, serves the files that form web pages to the web users.
To process a request a web server may respond with a static HTML page or image, send a redirect or delegate the dynamic response generation to some other program such as CGI scripts, JSPs, servlets, ASPs, server side java scripts or some other server side technology.
Web server employs various strategies for fault tolerance and scalability such as load balancing, caching and clustering.
E.g., Apache, Tomcat, IBM HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS, lighttpd, Google GWS.
